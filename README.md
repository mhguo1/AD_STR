# AD_STR

Repository for code used in Guo et al. analysis of short tandem repeats in Alzheimer's disease.

Here is a summary of the code:
A) STR genotyping
 1) ExpansionHunter genotyping (run_EH.sh)
 2) gangSTR genotying (run_gangSTR.sh)
 3) Custom code to convert gangSTR STR bed file to json file for ExpansionHunter
 4) Code to extract STR genotypes from vcf

B) Single STR association analyses
  1) Run single STR associations

C) Fisher's exact test for single STR burden analysis

D) STR expansion analysis
  1) Identification of STR expansions using DBSCAN algorithm
  2)
